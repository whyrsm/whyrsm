I'm a PM, but I ship code too.

Not because I want to be an engineer — I just got tired of waiting. With AI coding assistants (Cursor, Kiro, Claude, Gemini), I can go from idea to working system in days instead of quarters. ERPs, admission systems, WhatsApp bots, BI dashboards — I've built them all solo.

Turns out, when you can build the thing yourself, you make better product decisions. You know what's actually hard vs what just sounds hard. You stop over-engineering specs. You ship faster.

- Got a company award at eFishery (Q1 2024)

## What I'm doing now

**Kav & Co** — My company. We help businesses figure out what to build and then actually build it.

**Kobi Education** — Consulting on product. Trying to get them to stop thinking in features and start thinking in outcomes.

**ITAF Global Islamic School** — Co-founded this. Preparing Indonesian students for universities in the Middle East.

## Things I've built (solo, with AI)

**BelajarShafa** — Mentoring platform for Indonesian organizations. Class management, LMS, the whole thing.

**Boogie ERP** — Garment manufacturing system. Quotations to production to delivery.

**Permai ERP** — Wholesale distribution for baby products. Inventory, supply chain, retail outlets.

**Abata PMB** — Student enrollment system for schools (KB through SMP).

Stack is usually NestJS + Next.js + PostgreSQL + Railway. n8n for automation, WAHA for WhatsApp.

## My AI setup

I write about this on [Medium](https://whyrsm.medium.com).

**LLMs I use daily:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5), Gemini 3  
**AI IDEs:** Cursor, Antigravity, Kiro  
**Automation:** n8n workflows, WAHA for WhatsApp bots

The way I see it: AI doesn't replace thinking, it just removes the bottleneck between thinking and doing.

## whyrsm

It's "why" + my initials. I ask why before I build. Most problems aren't what they look like at first glance.

## Talk to me

I like conversations about product strategy, building with AI, edtech, fintech, or just how to get teams to focus on outcomes instead of output.
