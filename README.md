I'm a product manager who codes.

I've always coded on the side — grinding HackerRank, contributing to open source, messing with SQL to escape PRDs. But the last time I shipped something commercial? Laravel 7, Bootstrap 4. That was 2020.

Then I discovered AI coding assistants. Complete 180.

In the last 6 months, I've shipped 4 production systems:

- A garment manufacturer coordinating through spreadsheets, WhatsApp, and chaos — now has structured workflows where everyone sees the same truth.

- A wholesale distributor blind to their own business — now has POS and accounting synced into one dashboard. Stock levels, branch performance, all visible.

- A school running enrollment through paper, phone calls, and manual follow-ups — now has registration, assessment, payment, and notifications in one integrated system.

- A mentoring organization scaling without structure — now has a full LMS with attendance, courses, and mentor notes.

This is what AI coding agents unlock for product people. I'm not writing every line — I'm solving problems faster than ever. Talk to users, build, ship, measure, repeat.

## How I work

**Product** — I focus on outcomes, not output. Shipping features is easy; solving the right problem is the hard part.

**Leadership** — I've led cross-functional teams and built product culture in organizations. I believe in coaching over directing.

**Technical** — I read code, write code, and have real technical conversations. It makes collaboration with engineers smoother.

**Education** — Teaching and mentoring are part of how I work. Co-founding a school deepened this.
