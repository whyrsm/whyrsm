I'm a product manager who codes.

I learned programming because I wanted to truly understand what I was asking engineers to build. With AI coding assistants, I now build production systems myself — ERPs, admission platforms, WhatsApp bots, BI dashboards.

This shapes how I approach product. I understand tradeoffs, I know what's feasible, and I can move from idea to working software quickly.

## How I work

**Product** — I focus on outcomes, not output. Shipping features is easy; solving the right problem is the hard part.

**Leadership** — I've led cross-functional teams and built product culture in organizations. I believe in coaching over directing.

**Technical** — I read code, write code, and have real technical conversations. It makes collaboration with engineers smoother.

**Education** — Teaching and mentoring are part of how I work. Co-founding a school deepened this.
