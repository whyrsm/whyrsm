## Philosophy

**whyrsm: asking why, build the way**

I approach problems by understanding the "why" before building the "way." This means:
- Challenging assumptions and clarifying ambiguities
- Optimizing for business outcomes over feature output
- Building systems that solve real problems, not perceived ones
- Teaching teams to think in outcomes, not outputs
