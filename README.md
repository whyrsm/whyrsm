## 💡 Product Philosophy

I shift organizations from feature factories to outcome-driven cultures. Success isn't measured by shipped features—it's measured by user outcomes and business KPIs. Whether building fintech platforms for aquaculture farmers or ERP systems for education clients, the approach remains: understand the problem deeply, architect pragmatically, deliver measurably.

- Translated regulatory compliance into scalable technical architecture (OJK licensing)
- Bridged non-technical stakeholders and engineering teams in complex enterprise environments
- Made critical build-vs-buy decisions that saved $500K+ while maintaining product velocity
- Built systems that balance ideal solutions with pragmatic delivery timelines

Currently preparing for Master's studies in Australia while scaling Kav & Co and education initiatives.
