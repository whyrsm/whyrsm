I'm a product manager who happens to code.

I started picking up programming because I wanted to understand what I was asking engineers to build. Over time, with help from AI coding assistants, I found myself building small systems on my own — internal tools, ERPs, bots. Nothing fancy, boring problem, but useful.

It's changed how I think about product. I'm more careful about what I ask for, more aware of tradeoffs.

## Background

I've spent most of my career in fintech and education. Along the way, I've been fortunate to:

- Work on products that reached 400K+ customers
- Help teams save on costs through better tooling decisions
- Lead a team through ISO27001 certification
- Learn from a lot of smart people

## Current roles

**Kav & Co** — A small company I co-founded. We help businesses think through their tech decisions and sometimes build things for them.

**Kobi Education** — I consult on product and technology. Mostly trying to help the team focus on what matters.

**ITAF Global Islamic School** — Co-founded with friends. We prepare students for universities in the Middle East.

## Side projects

I've built a few systems on my own using AI assistants — nothing groundbreaking, but they solve real problems:

- **BelajarShafa** — A mentoring platform for Indonesian organizations
- **Boogie ERP** — Internal system for a garment manufacturer
- **Permai ERP** — Distribution management for a wholesale company
- **Abata PMB** — Enrollment system for schools

I usually work with NestJS, Next.js, and PostgreSQL. n8n for automation.

## How I try to work

**Product** — I care about solving the right problems. Features are easy to ship, outcomes are harder.

**Leadership** — I've led teams before. Still learning how to do it well.

**Technical** — I can read and write code. It helps me have better conversations with engineers.

**Education** — I like teaching and mentoring when I can. Co-founding a school taught me a lot about learning itself.

## Tools I use

Cursor, Kiro, Claude, Gemini for coding assistance. n8n and WAHA for automation.
