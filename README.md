I'm a product manager who codes.

I've always coded on the side. Grinding HackerRank (before AI coding agent hype), contributing to systems for social projects, messing with SQL to escape PRDs. But the last time I shipped something commercial by myself? Laravel 7, Bootstrap 4. That was 2020 😅

Then I discovered AI coding assistants in mid 2025. Complete 180.

In the last 6 months, I've shipped 4 production systems through [Kav & Co](https://kav.co.id). Boring problems, not fancy, but useful. Helping real businesses work better:

- A garment manufacturer coordinating through spreadsheets, WhatsApp, and chaos. Now has structured workflows where everyone sees the same truth.

- A wholesale distributor blind to their own business. Now has POS and accounting synced into one dashboard. Stock levels, branch performance, all visible.

- A school running enrollment through paper, phone calls, and manual follow-ups. Now has registration, assessment, payment, and notifications in one integrated system.

- A mentoring organization scaling without structure. Now has a full LMS with attendance, courses, and mentor notes.

This is what AI coding agents unlock for product people. Talk to users, build, ship, measure, repeat.

And no, it's not vibe coding. At least at this scale and stage, I think about architecture, write maintainable code, and build systems that can be handed off to real engineering teams. AI accelerates the work, but the technical decisions are mine.

NestJS, Next.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL. Railway for infra, I'd rather solve problems than configure CI/CD.

AI coding with Cursor, Kiro, Claude Code. Favorite Models: Sonnet 4, Opus 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro.

n8n and WAHA for WhatsApp bots and automation.
